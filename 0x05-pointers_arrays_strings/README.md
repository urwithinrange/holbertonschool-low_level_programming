This directory is the introduction to pointers arrays and strings.
We are expected to know:
What a pointer is
What arrays are and how to use them
What are the differences between pointers and arrays
How to use strings and how to manipulate them
Scope of variables

During the creation of our functions we are not allowed to use the standard library.
We are only allowed to use _putchar

The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in a header file called holberton.h
